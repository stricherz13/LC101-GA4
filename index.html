        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was raised on a farm in rural South Dakota. In my teenage years I was obsessed with playing guitar and
        being in a metal band. After graduating from high school I went to a trade school to become an electrician. I
        dropped out after one semester to pursue my interest in playing guitar in a metal band. I joined a local metal
        band, recorded an album, and played a handful of local venues throughout the midwest.</p>

        <h2>Occupation</h2>
        <p>I realized in my early 20s that I needed to make a change in my life. I enrolled in a local community college
        and started my journey through college. </p>
