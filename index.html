        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was raised on a farm in rural South Dakota. In my teenage years I was obsessed with playing guitar and
        being in a metal band. After graduating from high school I went to a trade school to become an electrician. I
        dropped out after one semester to pursue my interest in playing guitar in a metal band. I joined a local metal
        band, recorded an album, and played a handful of local venues throughout the midwest.</p>

        <h2>Occupation</h2>
        <p>I realized in my early 20s that I needed to make a change in my life. I enrolled in a local community college
        and started my journey through college. In 2007, I graduated from Community College with an Associate degree.
        I then enrolled in a local state university to study geography, political science, and global studies. I graduated
        with an undergraduate degree in 2009. An adjunct professor offered my a job with the federal government. I have
        worked for the federal government since 2009 in various departments.</p>

        <h2>Recreation</h2>
        <p>As you may have guessed from my choice of occupation and education that I am interested in traveling and
        experiencing the world. I have been to every permanently inhabited content except South America. I have lived in
        Asia and the Middle East. I am currently planning to spend more time in Central America. I love to participate in
        wind and water sports such as surfing and Scuba diving when traveling.</p>

        <a id="dreams"></a>
        <h2>Dreams and Goals</h2>
        <p>My current dream is to change careers to be a software developer. I am interested in using open-source tools
        such as Django, Flask, Postgres/PostGIS, QGIS, Jupyter notebooks, Geosever, Leaflet, and Open Layers to create Web GIS
        and Web Mapping Web Applications to solve problems.</p>

        <p>I am also involved in the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement and hope to retire at the age
        of 50 and move to Beleize to enjoy the warm weather and beautiful beaches while working remotely on passion projects.</p>
